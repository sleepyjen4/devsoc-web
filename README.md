## The Year of the Horse 
Run as a horse through the day or night, jumping over sacred lanterns. As darkness falls, speed increases, so you have to adapt fast! Reach 2026 to claim good fortune and blessings for the year ahead.

Note: *This game is still under development*. As this is my first time creating a web-based game like this, it may still contain bugs... thank you for your patience and understanding!

### Why did I make this game? 
This cute, simple horse game was inspired by the upcoming Chinese New Year. Since I’m sadly not in my home country, Malaysia, to celebrate with my family, I wanted to create a small game that captures the spirit of the occasion with a bit of excitement and some playful New Year luck.

## CSS Structure 

This project uses multiple CSS files for better organisation:

- **base.css** – general page styles and fonts  
- **game.css** – game layout, score sytem, and background  
- **sprites.css** – characters and obstacles (sun/moon, horse, lanterns)
- **ui.css** – menu layout and buttons
