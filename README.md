The Year of the Horse

⚠️ Best experienced on desktop. ⚠️
This game isn’t optimised for mobile yet (responsive design is still a work in progress!), and gameplay relies on keyboard controls.

Run as a horse through the day or night, jumping over sacred lanterns. As darkness falls, speed increases, so you have to adapt fast! Reach 2026 to claim good fortune and blessings for the year ahead.

Note: _This game is still under development_. As this is my first time creating a web-based game like this, it may still contain bugs... thank you for your patience and understanding! Feedback or help would be most appreciated!

### How to play?

- Your task is to get to 2026.
- Use any key on the keyboard to make the horse jump and avoid the lanterns.
- Be careful, at night it speeds up. A hint is to check the movement of the sun.
- You get bonus points during night time!
- You only have one chance and it's game over. (If you wish to retry your luck, refresh the page :D)

### Why did I make this game?

This cute, simple horse game was inspired by the upcoming Chinese New Year. Since I’m sadly not in my home country, Malaysia, to celebrate with my family, I wanted to create a small game that captures the spirit of the occasion with a bit of excitement and some playful New Year luck.

## CSS Structure

This project uses multiple CSS files for better organisation:

- **base.css** – general page styles and fonts
- **game.css** – game layout, score sytem, and background
- **sprites.css** – characters and obstacles (sun/moon, horse, lanterns)
- **ui.css** – menu layout and buttons
- **aboutme.css** – css styling for the "About Me" page
